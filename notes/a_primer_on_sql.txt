primary key vs unique key:
PK cannot have NULL value, UK can be NULL (but only one).
You can define only one PK (although PK can be a combination of multiple fields)
You can have multiple UK fields

CTAS is not straight forward in sqlite, PK and UK are not copied into the new table.
CTAS - Create Table As
